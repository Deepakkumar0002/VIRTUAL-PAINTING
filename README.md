# VIRTUAL-PAINTING
Virtual Painting (Python Project): A gesture-based painting application developed in Python using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It tracks hand landmarks in real time and allows users to draw on a virtual canvas using finger gestures. Users can select colors, erase, and switch tools with intuitive hand movementsâ€”no mouse or stylus required.
